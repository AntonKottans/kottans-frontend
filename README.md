## Git Basics

I have already been introduced to git thanks to githowto.com, but learngitbranching.js.org helped a lot to understand it better.

Brand new for me was upstream.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

#### Linux CLI

Since i am a Debian GNU/Linux user, new commands for me were just "more" and "finger".

Though there was nothing complicated, last exercise in lesson about fonts was like "What do you want from me???". After reset i wrote the same and it worked. Codecademy's editor was good until lessons about flex and grid becouse of long loading and loosing connection while typing.
